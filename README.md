Hi there! Welcome to my Spotify music analysis project. All our findings have been organized and presented on a webpage for easy access.
For this project, I collaborated with some friends to explore music trends and answer some intriguing questions. 
Our main focus was to analyze what makes a music artist popular. Can we derive a formula for creating a hit song? If so, what are the key 'ingredients'?
We also tackled a few other fascinating questions. Feel free to dive into the code and check out the insights we uncovered.
